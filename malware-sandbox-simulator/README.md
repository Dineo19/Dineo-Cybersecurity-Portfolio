# 🛡️ Malware Behavior Sandbox Simulator

A SAFE Python-based malware behavior simulator that imitates how real malware behaves — without causing any system harm.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of malware analysis, SOC detection workflows, and incident response.

---

## 🔥 Simulated Behaviors

- File encryption attempts  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Command-and-Control (C2) traffic  
- Privilege escalation attempts  
- Logging malicious behavior  

No real malware is created — everything is **100% safe**.
