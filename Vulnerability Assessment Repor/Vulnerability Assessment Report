Windows 10 workstation	Employee laptop
Windows Server 2019	Domain Controller
Linux Ubuntu Server	Web application server
Network Firewall	Controls traffic

Tools used:

Nmap (Port scanning)

OpenVAS (Vulnerability scanning)

Windows Security Baseline Checker

3. Methodology

Assessment followed these steps:

Reconnaissance – Identify open ports and services using Nmap

Scanning – Run vulnerability scan using OpenVAS

Analysis – Review risk ratings (CVSS scores)

Prioritization – Rank vulnerabilities by severity

Recommendations – Provide actionable security fixes

4. Findings
🔴 High-Risk Vulnerabilities
1. Windows Server 2019 – Missing Security Patches

Risk Level: High

Description: Server has not installed critical patches for 3 months.

Impact: Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution).

Solution:

Apply all Windows Updates immediately

Enable automatic update policy

2. Weak Administrator Password

Risk Level: High

Description: Password found: Admin123

Impact: Easy for brute-force attacks

Solution:

Enforce complex password policy

Use MFA for admin accounts

🟡 Medium-Risk Vulnerabilities
3. Outdated Apache Web Server

Risk Level: Medium

Description: Running Apache 2.4.29 (released 2018)

Impact: Known vulnerabilities exist

Solution: Upgrade to latest version (2.4.62+)

4. Firewall – Unnecessary Open Port

Risk Level: Medium

Port: 23 (Telnet)

Impact: Telnet is insecure and sends data unencrypted

Solution:

Disable Telnet

Replace with SSH

🟢 Low-Risk Vulnerabilities
5. Windows 10 Workstation – Disabled Firewall

Risk Level: Low

Impact: Device is vulnerable to local network attacks

Solution: Re-enable Windows Defender Firewall

5. Prioritized Remediation Plan
Priority	Vulnerability	Fix Timeline
Critical	Missing Server Patches	24 hours
Critical	Weak Password	Immediate
Medium	Outdated Apache Server	3 days
Medium	Open Telnet Port	2 days
Low	Disabled Firewall	1 week
